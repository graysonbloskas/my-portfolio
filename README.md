# My Portfolio
## About This Project
An employer asked for all employees to create a webpage that contained our general details, work experience, resume, and contact info. 

### A few Components
* I utilize a navbar at the top right of the screen, which links with #id tags to their corresponding spaces on the page. 
* The about me section contains a little info about me. I used display:flex to format this section. 
* Used justfiy-content: space-between, which evenly spaced items in my containers, like my navbar, and images. 
* Used absolute position on my name "Grayson Bloskas," tag "img-name" to stick my name to my hero image. 
* Created a media screen query that shrinks the font size of the navbars from 16px to 12px, when the user's screen is shrunk below 600px.
